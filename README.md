# TODO List React and Fetch

> By Keili Rosales

## Objective

The main idea of this exercise is to learn how to use API's and apply it to the TODO-list made earlier, so we took advantage of the same boilerplate to synchronize the task list with a real database, in this case, using the RESTful and public API made for this exercise.

ðŸ”— Here you can take a look at the [TODO-list API documentation.](http://https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/fake/todos/ "TODO-list API documentation.")

The exercise is about applying asynchronous programming because the interactions from and to the server must be performed asynchronously. It was left with customizing the TODO with the Christmas theme.

## Application

1. Install the NPM packages (be sure to use the latest version of node): `npm install`.
2. Run the project using: `npm run start`.
It checks that the component is working and can add and remove tasks, as well as send and get the data in the API.

## Technologies
